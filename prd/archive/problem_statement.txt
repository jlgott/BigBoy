# 2. Problem Statement

## 2.1 Current State
- Multiple disconnected data sources (sensors, oil samples, maintenance events, fault codes)
- SME-defined rules numbering in the thousands
- Rules are contradictory, unversioned, and impossible to validate
- High false positive rates eroding trust
- No systematic way to learn from historical failures
- Tribal knowledge not captured in systems

## 2.2 Desired State
- Unified system that ingests all data types
- Pattern matching against historical failure-adjacent data
- Explainable flags with links to historical evidence
- System that improves with each failure
- SMEs validate patterns rather than author rules
