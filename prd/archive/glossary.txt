| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Chunk** | Unit of data for comparison (sensor window, oil sample, event rollup) |
| **Feature Vector** | Numeric representation of a chunk for distance calculation |
| **Temporal Score** | Label indicating proximity to failure (the training signal) |
| **Relevance Score** | Weight based on component mapping |
| **Trust Score** | Weight based on source reliability |
| **Flag** | Generated when new chunk scores above threshold |
| **Failure-adjacent** | Chunks that preceded a failure event |
| **Fleet baseline** | Statistical baseline across all assets of a model |
| **KNN** | K-nearest neighbors algorithm for similarity search |
| **BM25** | Best Matching 25 - ranking function for text/token similarity |
| **Token** | Structured text representation of event (e.g., COMPONENT\|SUB\|TYPE) |
| **Event window** | Rolling time window (e.g., 14 days) of events for a single asset |
| **Distance weighting** | Closer neighbors have higher influence on score (weight = 1/distance) |
