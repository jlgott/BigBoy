# BigBoy: Predictive Failure Detection

## The Vision

A system that remembers every failure we've ever had—and watches for the warning signs to happen again.

All data linked back to significant events: failures, near-misses, interventions, known bad patterns. Every new piece of data scored against these learnings and assessed for risk.

When a threshold is breached, a team of AI agents activates. Not one model—a squad. One pulls recent events. One checks oil trends. One scans sensor behavior. One reviews asset history. They cross-reference, corroborate, and build a case.

The result surfaces to a human: a recommendation backed by historical evidence and context. Not a black-box alert—a reasoned assessment with receipts.

800 assets. Continuous coverage. Failures caught before they happen.

## The Problem Today

We have data everywhere. Oil samples in one system. Fault codes in another. Sensor readings in a third. Maintenance history scattered across spreadsheets and tribal knowledge.

We have thousands of rules—accumulated over years, written by people who've since left, contradicting each other, impossible to validate.

We have smart people doing manual triage, but they can't watch 800 assets every day. Things slip through. Failures happen that, in hindsight, had warning signs we missed.

## The Shift

Instead of humans chasing data, the system brings the case to them.

Instead of static rules, the system learns from outcomes.

Instead of one alert with no context, a team of agents builds the full picture.

The human still decides. But now they're deciding with evidence, not hunting for it.

## What This Enables

- **Proactive maintenance** — act on early warnings, not breakdowns
- **Institutional memory** — learnings captured in the system, not lost when people leave
- **Scalable attention** — AI handles the grunt work, humans handle judgment
- **Continuous improvement** — every decision feeds back, the system gets smarter

## What Success Looks Like

One caught failure that we would have missed otherwise.

Then another. Then it becomes the way we work.
